# Expy - Expense Tracker App

### **Problem:**

Many expense tracker applications are available as paid mobile or web apps. These apps can come as a subscription or one time payment model.

### **Solution:**

We have decided to create an expense tracker that is free for our own learning purposes, mainly to learn new frameworks and technologies.

### **Features:**

1. Login
2. Dashboard Page

- Current Amount
- Latest Transaction History
- Budgets
- More to add..

3. Transaction History Page

- Show transaction history with selectable date range

4. Transactions Page

- To add transactions with tagged categories

### **MVP User stories:**

1. As a user, I want to login and see the dashboard with relevant information at 1 glance.
2. As a user, I want to add my transactions/expenses for the day.
3. As a user, I want to see my transaction history with a selectable date range.

### **Tech Stack:**

1. React
2. Flask
